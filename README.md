ADXL362B Accelerometer Android Things Library

This is WIP. Expect things to work in a different way or not to work at all. Pull requests for betterments and fixes are welcome.

ADXL362 has two operating modes:

```
1. Measurement mode;  for continuous, wide bandwidth sensing.
2. Wake-up mode; for limited bandwidth activity detection.
```
